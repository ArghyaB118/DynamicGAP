# Dynamic GAP
Question: What is GAP?
GAP is a static graph processing benchmark.

## GAP Benchmark Suite included.
We merged the GAP benchmark BFS implementation.
In order to use the BFS from GAp, we used the following header files from GAP implementations:
1. sliding_queue
2. bitmap
3. pvector
4. platform_atomics

btree implementation is done by Google as part of the absl implementation.
Instructions: https://code.google.com/archive/p/cpp-btree/wikis/UsageInstructions.wiki
Number of edges will be limited to ~2B if we take 'int' to contain edge_list.
Hence, we used 'long int'.
Assumption: The nodes are marked from 0 onwards.

## Using graph converters from .adj to .el
g++ -o adj_to_el adj_to_el.cc -std=c++11 -O3
./adj_to_el INPUT_FILE OUTPUT_FILE

## Sanity check for GAP benchmark
The runtime matches between Dynamic GAP benchmark and the native GAP benchmark. Note that, Dynamic GAP benchmark uses individual btrees to store the in- and out-neighbors, whereas GAP uses CSR representation of a graph.
1. GAP's `src/` is clones in `src-gap/`.
2. Build `bfs.cc` by running `g++ -std=c++11 -O3 -Wall -fopenmp src-gap/bfs.cc`. Skip the option `-fopenmp` if not suppported on mac.
3. Run `./a.out -f graphs/slashdot.el`
